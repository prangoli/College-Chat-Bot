The importance of formulating appropriate questions, survey structure and flow, the difference between surveys and interviews, and how observation can provide deep insights into user behavior and needs is explained.

The third class focuses on the ideation phase of Design Thinking, emphasizing the importance of generating many ideas and prioritizing them. Key concepts like user-centered design, interdisciplinary collaboration, and rapid prototyping are explored. A simplified version of the Design Thinking process is presented: understanding, ideating, and prototyping.

In the fourth and fifth classes, the Blue Ocean Strategy is introduced, aiming for differentiation without relying on existing competition. The concepts of red oceans and blue oceans are explained, where the former represents saturated markets with high competition and the latter new market areas with growth opportunities without direct competition. The ERIC Matrix (Eliminate, Reduce, Increase, Create) is a key tool for identifying innovation opportunities in value, seeking a balance between differentiation and low costs. Examples like Cirque du Soleil, Ford T, and Dell illustrate how these companies managed to innovate and create new markets.

Finally, the creation of value curves is addressed, a graphical representation of users' perception of value, helping to identify market niches without competition and focusing innovation efforts on variables that truly matter to customers.

Additional material for the SIPII TN 1C 2024 course covers various topics focused on effective information presentation, prototype creation, user experience design, and team management in a technological project development context.

The Storytelling with Data class emphasizes the importance of using data effectively to tell compelling stories. The structure for talking about data includes introducing the topic, explaining the method used, presenting results, and concluding concisely. Six keys to telling stories with data according to Cole Nussbaumer are mentioned: understanding the context, choosing appropriate graphics, eliminating clutter, focusing attention, thinking like a designer, and telling a story. The class also addresses principles of Gestalt psychology applied to data visualization, highlighting how people perceive patterns and structures in visual presentations.

The Design Thinking III - Prototyping class explains the importance of creating prototypes to visualize, test, and experiment with ideas. It is mentioned that prototypes help reduce uncertainty, validate ideas, and obtain early user feedback. The phases of prototyping: sketch, wireframe, mockup, and prototype are detailed, and collaborative tools for each phase are suggested. It is emphasized that prototypes should be iterative, allowing constant adjustments and improvements based on user feedback.

The Oratory class provides tips for improving the verbal presentation of ideas. Carmine Gallo's nine tips for making exciting, original, and memorable presentations are mentioned. These tips include bringing out the teacher within, telling stories, having a conversation, sharing something new, creating moments of wonder, using all senses, relaxing and using genuine humor, being transparent and authentic, and managing time well. Effective narrative structures and the importance of adapting language and interaction with the audience are also highlighted.

The Storytelling class explains the concept of storytelling and its impact on creating engagement and attention in the audience. Joseph Campbell's hero's journey model is used to structure stories, highlighting stages such as the call to adventure, refusal to participate, crossing the threshold, facing challenges, transformation, and returning with the elixir. It is emphasized how these stages can be applied to the narrative of projects and products to make them more attractive and meaningful to users.

The Management 3.0 class introduces a new perspective on team management, focusing on treating teams as complex and adaptive systems. The importance of energizing people, empowering teams, aligning constraints, developing competencies, scaling structures, and improving the whole is highlighted. Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation is also addressed, and tools for effective feedback are presented, such as the Feedback Wrap, which focuses on a more human and proactive approach.

The User Experience Design class focuses on increasing user satisfaction through a deep understanding of their needs and behaviors. The differences between experience, interface, and interaction are explained, and how these concepts are integrated into the design of products and services. Nielsen's heuristics are highlighted as general principles for interaction design, including system status visibility, system and real-world match, user control and freedom, consistency and standards, error prevention, recognition over recall, flexibility and efficiency of use, aesthetic and minimalist design, help users recover from errors, and help and documentation.

Finally, the Nielsen Heuristics Examples class provides practical examples of how these heuristics are applied and not applied in interface design, highlighting the importance of following these principles to improve usability and user satisfaction. Students are encouraged to identify and analyze real examples of compliance and non-compliance with these heuristics as part of their learning.

Additional course material for SIPII TN 1C 2024 covers key aspects of developing a business plan, detailing the phases and necessary elements for creating a solid business model and projecting the financial analysis of a project.

In the Business Plan I class, the Business Model Canvas (BMC) is introduced as a fundamental tool for defining and creating innovative business models. The BMC simplifies the process into four main areas: customers, offer, infrastructure, and economic viability. Different business models are explained, such as long tail, freemium, bait and hook, advertising, and subscription, providing concrete examples and highlighting their characteristics and applications. Customer segments, value proposition, channels, customer relationships, revenue streams, key resources, key activities, key partners, and cost structure are also broken down, providing a comprehensive view of how to structure a successful business model.

The Business Plan II class delves into the financial analysis of the business plan, presenting the profit and loss (P&L) report. This report is crucial for breaking down and projecting income and expenses, helping to put numbers to the business model and determine when profits will begin to be obtained. Important points such as identifying the required initial investment, when income and benefits will begin, and when the initial investment will be recovered are highlighted. The coherence of the P&L with the roadmap, the work team, and the BMC is emphasized, ensuring that all elements of the business plan are aligned.

In the Guidelines for Submission 2 class, the general aspects and minimum content required for the second project submission are specified. This includes the iteration and correction of the first submission, the creation of a roadmap with dates and milestones, the definition of the work team with roles and justifications, a heuristic analysis for the final version of the prototype, the definition of OKRs (objectives and key results), and the elaboration of a complete business plan with BMC and business model. Additionally, the documentation of prototype validation with end-users and changes made in each iteration is required. Evaluation criteria are based on the clarity and preparation of the document, the use of research and Design Thinking tools, the value of conclusions, and knowledge and mastery of the subject. The final submission will be on june 20th.
